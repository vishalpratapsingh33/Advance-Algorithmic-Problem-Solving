////A linked list is a linear data structure in which elements (called nodes) are not stored in contiguous memory, but are connected via pointers.
//Applications in Algorithm Design
//1. Stacks and Queues
//Can be implemented using linked lists easily with O(1) operations.

// 2. Hash Tables
//Linked lists handle collisions in separate chaining.

//3. Graph Representations
//Adjacency lists are implemented as arrays of linked lists.

//4. Memory Management (OS)
//Free memory blocks (heap, pages) are often tracked using linked lists.

//5. Undo/Redo in editors
//Doubly linked lists keep track of changes forward and backward.

//6. LRU Cache
//Combines a hash map and doubly linked list to maintain order and speed.

//7. Polynomial Arithmetic
//Each node represents a term in the polynomial (value and exponent).
